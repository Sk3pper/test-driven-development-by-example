# Lessons learned
- When you have clean, well-tested code, you don’t need to overthink every decision. Instead of spending several minutes reasoning through a problem, make the change and run the tests - your test suite can give you an answer in seconds. This is one of the great strengths of TDD: it allows you to experiment confidently. Without tests, you're forced to rely solely on reasoning. With tests, you have the freedom to try something and quickly get feedback.
