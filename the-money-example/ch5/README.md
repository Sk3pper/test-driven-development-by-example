# Lessons learned
*Strategy adopted*: Got a new test case working in the direction of the final test to implement.

The "**$5 + 10 CHF = $10 if rate is 2:1**" test it still seems to be a big leap. A prerequisite seems to be having an object like *Dollar*, but to represent *franc*. If we can get the object Franc to work the way that the object Dollar works now (**5 CHF * 2 = 10 CHF**) , we'll be closer to being able to write and run the mixed addition test.
