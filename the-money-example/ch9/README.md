# Lessons learned
- How do we want to test for currencies at the moment?
- TDD is a continuous tuning process. If tiny steps feel too restrictive, take slightly larger ones. If you're unsure or lacking clarity, take smaller, safer steps. There’s no fixed “correct” step size - it depends on the situation. TDD is about steering and adjusting as you go, not following a rigid formula.
