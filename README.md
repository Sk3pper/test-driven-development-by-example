# 🧪 Test-Driven Development by Example
Welcome to the repository for the book Test-Driven Development by Example by Kent Beck.
This repo contains a step-by-step walkthrough of the concepts, exercises, and code examples presented in the book.

# 🔄 Process to keep in mind
The TDD cycle is as follows:
1. Add a little test.
2. Run all tests and fail.
3. Make a change.
4. Run the tests and succeed.
5. Refactor to remove duplication.
