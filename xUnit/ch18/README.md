# To-do list
- [x] **~~Invoke test method~~**
- [ ] Invoke setUp first
- [ ] Invoke tearDown afterward
- [ ] Invoke tearDown even if the test method fails
- [ ] Run multiple tests
- [ ] Report collected results

# Lessons learned
- Take code that works in one instance and generalize it to work by replacing constants with variables. TDD makes this work well by giving you running concrete examples from which to generalize instead of having to generalize with **reasoning**.
- Put the operations near the data.
